			A video game or computer game is an electronic game that involves interaction with a user interface or input device – such as a joystick, controller, keyboard, or motion sensing device – to generate visual feedback. 
			This feedback mostly commonly is shown on a video display device, such as a TV set, monitor, touchscreen, or virtual reality headset. Some computer games do not always depend on a graphics display, 
			for example text adventure games and computer chess can be played through teletype printers. Video games are often augmented with audio feedback delivered through speakers or headphones, and 
			sometimes with other types of feedback, including haptic technology.

			Video games are defined based on their platform, which include arcade video games, console games, and personal computer (PC) games. 
			More recently, the industry has expanded onto mobile gaming through smartphones and tablet computers, virtual and augmented reality systems, 
			and remote cloud gaming. Video games are classified into a wide range of genres based on their type of gameplay and purpose.
